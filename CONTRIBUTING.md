## Project Setup

1. **Install prerequisites**
   - Node.js **20.19.0** or newer
   - npm **10.x** (bundled with Node 20)
2. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/go-learning-app.git
   cd go-learning-app
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start the dev server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app is available at <http://localhost:5173>. Vite reloads automatically when you save files.

## Development Workflow

- Create a feature branch from `main`:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feat/<short-description>
  ```
- Keep your fork up to date:
  ```bash
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/<upstream-owner>/go-learning-app.git
  git fetch upstream
  git rebase upstream/main
  ```
- Make small, focused commits. Prefer conventional-style messages if possible (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:` ...).

## Coding Guidelines

- TypeScript is required for new logic. Extend types in `src/types` when needed.
- Manipulate global state via Pinia actions defined in `src/stores/game.ts`.
- Keep UI responsive. When adding components, check the layout at 19√ó19, 13√ó13, and 9√ó9 board sizes.
- If you introduce third-party dependencies, justify the addition in your pull request.
- Before submitting a PR, run:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  npm run preview   # optional manual smoke test
  ```

## Submitting Changes

1. Ensure your branch is rebased onto the latest `main`.
2. Push your branch and open a pull request on GitHub.
3. Fill out the PR template (if available) and include:
   - A summary of the change.
   - Screenshots or GIFs for UI updates.
   - Testing steps you followed.
4. Be responsive to review feedback; discussions are part of the collaboration.

## Reporting Issues

- Search existing issues first to avoid duplicates.
- When filing a bug, include:
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Expected vs. actual behaviour
  - Browser/OS information
  - Screenshots or console logs when relevant
- Feature requests should explain the problem being solved and, if possible, offer a suggested approach.

## Community Expectations
